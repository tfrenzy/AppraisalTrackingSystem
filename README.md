# AppraisalTrackingSystem
This is a final year project done for a student to implement a scaled down version of a typical appraisal system that companies use to evaluate staff performance at regular intervals. The project had provision for two groups of users, basic users, the staff who could log in and do the basic staff functions, fill questionnaires and admin staff who were responsible for viewing the questionnaire results and make evaluations based on the answers. Admin could also organise and have a birds eye view of all the basic staff. The project is done with PHP and utilises a mySQL database for its data.
